\chapter{Safety and the PR2}
Point out which parts of the code are considered part of the hardware safety systems (e.g. joint current limits), and make it clear that changing them can cause problems.

Talk about guidelines for safe operation (e.g. is it OK in a normal lab environment?)

\chapter{PR2 hardware}

\section{What's in the box}
The PR2 will arrives in a big crate.  In the crate should be:
\subsection{PR2 robot}
\subsection{Wireless run-stop}
\label{wirelessrunstop}
The PR2 comes with an \href{http://www.omnexcontrols.com/products/portable/t50.html}{OMNEX T50} 
wireless run stop transmitter which when stopped or out of range will halt the motors and put the power system in standby mode.

\caption{The PR2 wireless run stop.}
\label{fig:runstop}
\end{figure}

To start the run stop transmitting, press the green start button (Figure~\ref{fig:runstop}) which will start the transmitting 
light flashing. While transmitting the run stop has a range of approximately 800ft. The run stop is powered by 4AA batteries 
when the batteries are low the battery light will flash warning you to change the batteries.

\section{Power system}
\subsection{Overview}
The PR2 has a Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery system that is charged off of 120V wall current and provides power the computers, motors, and sensors in the system.  Power distribution is controlled by the {\it Power Board}, which communicates over Ethernet.
\subsection{Power Busses}
The robot has several internal power busses:
\begin{description}
\item[120v] The robot has a 3-prong IEC320 plug in the back, which is connected through a circuit breaker to the inputs of the four AC-DC converters that are used to charge the battery packs.  The system is designed to pull up to 15A, so it is OK to plug the robot in to any 15A wall socket, but you should make sure there aren't other devices which draw significant power, such as computers, on the same circuit.
\item[Motor Power Bus] The motor controllers are fed from circuit breakers on the power board that can be in one of thre states.  When enabled, they provide a direct connection to the unregulated battery power, which ranges from 52V when the batteries are fully discharged up to 72V when connected to wall power.  When the motors are in standby mode, the power board provides a low-power 18V supply which is used for communication and to maintaing encoder position counts.  In the event of a major power-system problem, or if manually disabled, these circuit-breakers will also shut completely off without cutting power to the computers or sensors.  There are three independent motor power busses - left arm, right arm, and base/head.
\item[12V system bus]
12V power for sensors.  This is also the recommended source of power for user modifications. Provided by the power board.
\item[12V computer power]
12V power for computers.  Provided by the power board.
\end{description}
\subsection{Batteries}
The battery system has four battery bays comprised of four \href{http://www.oceanserver-store.com/18.html}{Ocean Server BA95HC-FL}
14.4V Li-ion batteries, a \href{http://www.v-infinity.com/adtemplate_child.asp?c=710918&p=903285&catky=764537&subcatky1=46887&subcatky2=320934}{V-INFINITY VF-S320-18A-CF}
18V AC-DC Power Supply, and a \href{http://www.oceanserver-store.com/xpmibamamo.html}{Ocean Server XP-04SRW} four channel high current battery controller. 
This provides approximately N hours of countinous operation after a full recharge. For more information please see the 
\href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/ocean\_server}{ocean\_server} package at \href{http://www.ros.org}{ros.org}.
