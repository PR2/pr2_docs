\chapter{PR2 hardware}

\section{What's in the box}
The PR2 ships in 3 packages:

\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
\hline      
  Robot crate & Large wooden crate which contains the PR2 itself \\ \hline
  Accessory crate & Crate which contains accessory kit, tool kit, and robot base-station \\ \hline
  Calibration target & Large checkerboard for accurate calibration of stereo cameras \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{PR2}
See later sections for more detail on the PR2 robot itself and how to get it out of the crate.
\subsection{Accessory kit}
\subsubsection{Wireless Joystick}
The PR2 ships with a bluetooth joystick for teleoperating the robot. The
bluetooth joystick is a
\href{http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&productId=8198552921665411965#additionalImage1%22}{Sony
  DUALSHOCK3} (Figure~\ref{fig:ps3joy}) wireless controller. It can be charged
using any standard USB A to mini-B USB cable. For more information, see the
\href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/ps3joy}{ps3joy} package at
\href{http://www.ros.org}{ros.org}.

\subsubsection{Wireless run-stop}
\label{wirelessrunstop}
The PR2 comes with an
\href{http://www.omnexcontrols.com/products/portable/t50.html}{OMNEX T50}
wireless run-stop transmitter. When the red button is pressed, or the unit is
out of range, the wireless run-stop transmitter will halt the motors and put the
power system in standby mode.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=150px]{run_stop.png}
\caption{The PR2 wireless run-stop.}
\label{fig:wirelessrunstop}
\end{figure}

To start the run-stop, press the green start button (Figure~\ref{fig:wirelessrunstop});
if this works properly, you will see a light flashing on the run-stop. While
transmitting, the run-stop has a range of approximately 800 ft. The run-stop is
powered by four AA batteries; the battery light will flash when the battery
charge is low and new batteries are required.

\subsubsection{15 FT Robot Power Cord and 3-foot self plug-in Robot Power Cord}
\TODO{Include images of both power cords} To recharge the PR2's batteries, it
must be plugged into a 120V electrical outlet.  Use only the provided power
cords - many power cords and power strips have thinner conductors and cannot
safely supply the current required by the PR2.  Using inappropriate cables is
hazardous and may cause fire.  When plugging the robot is to charge by hand, you
may use either cable.  When attepting to have the PR2 plug itself in, you must
use the shorter self-plug-in cord with attached checkerboard.  The self-plug-in
cord has magnets on the side opposite the checkerboard which should be used to
attach it to the base as shown \TODO{Include image of self-plug-in cable
  attached to magnets}

\subsubsection{Sensorized fingertips and boots}
\TODO{Include image of fingertips and boots} The PR2 ships with sensorless
fingertips attached.  We have also developed fingertips which have an integrated
22-element pressure sensor, but they are easy to damage and are not as robust as
the rest of the PR2.  We provide 5 fingertip sensors (2 for each gripper, plus 1
spare), as well as 20 rubber protective "boots" which prevent the sensor from
coming into direct contact with the environment.  When using the fingertip
sensors, you should always have an undamaged boot in good condition installed
over the sensor.  Continuing to use the fingertip sensors after the rubber boot
is damaged greatly increases the chance that you will damage the sensors
themselves.  See section \TODO{Create maintenance section for replacing
  fingertip sensors} for more information.

\subsubsection{Small calibration target}
\TODO{Include image of small checkerboard} This calibration target, which looks
like a checkerboard, is used for the PR2 self-calibration.  The robot holds the
checkerboard in one gripper and uses it to calibrate the arms, the head, the
cameras, and the tilting laser together.

\subsection{Toolkit}
\TODO{Include image of open toolkit, with callout labels to all tools by proper name}

\TODO{TBD: The robot toolkit is not yet fully defined}

\subsection{Large calibration target}
The large calibration target which ships with the robot looks like a
checkerboard 1" thick and approximately 3 feet on a side.  This is the
recommended calibration target to use for calibrating the intrinsics of the
stereo cameras on the robot.  The robot ships with stereo cameras already
calibrated, but you may need to re-calibrate occasionally as vibration and
thermal effects change the parameters over time.

\subsection{Base-station computer}
\TODO{Include picture of base-station here} The base-station computer ships
without a monitor, keyboard, or mouse.  See section ??? for more information on
how to configure your base-station.

\section{Mechanism}
PR2 is a 32-dof mobile manipulator with a mobile base, two arms, and a variety
of sensors on a pan-tilt head.

\subsection{Robot Anatomy}

\subsection{Terminology}
We talk about the robot kinematics using the concepts of joints, links, frames,
actuators, and transmissions.  Each of these is defined and represented in code,
as well as having a unique name.  In general, a single joint will have an
actuator and a transmission and will connect two links together.  A link is a
rigid body in the kinematic tree, and will have a coordinate frame, but not all
frames are associated with links.  We allow "fixed" joints, so some rigid bodies
that could be considered one link are considered to be two links rigidly joined
together.  This is done mostly at locations where there is a physical interface
between components.

\begin{description}
\item[Link] We consider a link to be a rigid body within the robot.  It
  generally has geometry to define visual and collision-space representations,
  has inertial properties, and has a name.  The links for the PR2 are defined in
  the "URDF" description that can be found in the pr2\_description package.
\item[Frame] Frames are geometric entities that represent coordinate frames in
  space.  Every link has an associated frame, but we also use frames to
  represent other things, such as the optical frame of a camera, the global map,
  or the location of a detected object.  Frames are always defined relative to
  one another, and relationships and transformations between them are tracked
  using the tf package.
\item[Joint] Joints are considered part of the robot, and define the
  relationship between links.  The joints for the PR2 are defined in the URDF
  description that can be found in the pr2\_description package.  The PR2 has
  mostly rotational joints, but the torso is translational, and there are also a
  number of "fixed" joints used to represent the notion that two links are part
  of the same rigid body.  Rotational and translational joints are generally
  represented in the same way in the system, and we refer to joint "effort"
  instead of force or torque, as well as using position, and velocity to
  represent both linear and angular movement.
\item[Actuator] The motor/encoder units in the PR2 are explicitly modelled as
  "actuators".  The actuator model treats them as torque sources with position
  measurement.  The details of the actuator model (e.g. the motor torque
  constant or max current), as well as the name of the actuator, are stored on
  the motor controller boards.
\item[Transmission] We use transmissions, also defined in the URDF robot
  description, to represent the mapping between actuators and joints.  They map
  actuator position into joint position (meters or radians), and map from
  commanded joint efforts (torques or forces) to actuator efforts.  In most
  cases in the robot this is a linear mapping between one joint and one actuator
  that just defines a reduction, but in the wrist we have 2 motors controlling
  two joints in a cross-coupled manner, and in the gripper the mapping from
  motor rotation to gripper position is non-linear.
\end{description}

In general, the names for a link and the associated frame will be similar
(e.g. r\_forearm\_link and r\_forearm\_frame), and the names for an actuator, a
transmission, and the associated joint will be similar
(e.g. r\_elbow\_flex\_motor, r\_elbow\_flex\_trans, and r\_elbow\_flex\_joint).
For components such as arms and casters that are included in the robot in
multiple locations, we use a short prefix to indicate which location we are
referring to

\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
\hline
  l\_ & left (from the robot's perspective) \\ \hline
  r\_ & right \\ \hline
  fr\_ & front right \\ \hline
  fl\_ & front left \\ \hline
  bl\_ & back left \\ \hline
  br\_ & back right \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Links and Joints}
By component, below is a list of the links and joints in the PR2:
\subsubsection{Base-Body-Spine}
The base-body-spine assembly of the PR2 has only one joint - the prismatic {\bf
  torso\_lift\_joint} which moves the torso up and down relative to the base.
The {\bf base\_link} holds the rear panel with electrical/network connections,
the computers, and the battery system, as well as bolting directly to the
casters.  The {\bf torso\_lift\_link}, which moves up and down, contains the
speaker, and the IMU, as well as serving as the attachment point for both arms
and for the head.
\subsubsection{Head}
The pan-tilt head which holds the wide and narrow stereo cameras, the 5
mega-pixel camera, and the texture projector is made up of two links - the {\bf
  head\_pan\_link}, connected to the torso by the {\bf head\_pan\_joint}, and
the {\bf head\_tilt\_link}, connected to the pan link by the {\bf
  head\_tilt\_joint}.  The sensors are all attached to the tilt link.

The upper Hokuyo laser range-finder is mounted to the {\ laser\_mount\_link},
which is tilted up and down by the {\bf laser\_tilt\_mount\_joint}
\subsubsection{Casters}
Each robot has four steered and driven casters, one at each corner of the base.
The casters are refered to as front right, front left, back right, and back
left.  They are named according to the above table of location prefixes ({\bf
  fr\_}, {\bf fl\_}, {\bf br\_}, and {\bf bl\_}).  Each caster consists of a
rotation joint {\bf location\_caster\_rotation\_joint}, which rotates or steers
the body of the caster, called the {\bf location\_caster\_rotation\_link},
around a vertical axis.  Attached to the body of the caster are two parallel
driven wheels, whose drive joints are {\bf location\_caster\_r\_wheel\_joint}
and {\bf location\_caster\_l\_wheel\_joint}.

\subsubsection{Arms}
The arm has 7 degrees of freedom.  Starting from the attachment to the torso,
the first joint is the {\bf location\_shoulder\_pan\_joint} which rotates the
{\bf location\_shoulder\_pan\_link}, or shoulder turret, around a vertical axis.

The shoulder turret contains the springs that store energy to counterbalance the
mass of the rest of the arm.  Two degrees of freedom, the {\bf
  location\_shoulder\_lift\_joint} and {\bf location\_upperarm\_roll\_joint}
attach the {\bf location\_upper\_arm\_link} to the shoulder.

The upper arm contains the counterbalance bar, which is a large steel bar that
attaches to the counterbalance attachment and transmits the counterbalance
forces into the structure of the arm.  The upper-arm also contains motors for
the {\bf location\_elbow\_flex\_joint} and {\bf location\_forearm\_roll\_joint},
which connect the forearm to the upper-arm.

The forearm ({\bf location\_forearm\_link}) contains a 640x480 color camera that
can always see the gripper, as well as the two motor which drive the {\bf
  wrist\_flex\_joint} and the continuous {\bf location\_wrist\_roll\_joint} that
attaches to the gripper.

\subsubsection{Grippers}
The gripper consists of a central palm link called the {\bf
  location\_gripper\_palm\_link} which is rigidly fixed to the {\bf
  location\_wrist\_roll\_link} and has a single actuated degree of freedom.  The
motor in the gripper drives the 4 joints of the gripper together to result in
parallel motion of the fingertips.  The parallel distance between the gripper
tips is treated as a translational joint, called {\bf location\_gripper\_joint}
that can be controlled.  The four rotational joints in the hand which are
constrained to move together are also modelled as joints which can be observed
but not controlled.  The gripper also contains a 3-dof accelerometer and an LED
which can be turned on and off to assist in calibration or finding the location
of the gripper in camera images.

\subsubsection{Home Pose}
In order to describe the PR2 robot pose and joint positions in a consistent
manner, a {\bf home pose} of the robot has been defined.  The {\bf home pose} is
described in detail in section~\ref{sec:pr2_coordinate_system}.

\subsubsection{Additional Information}
A CAD approximated kinematic and inertial description of the PR2 can be found in
the \href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2\_description}{pr2\_description} package.
This package uses a robot specific Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Document
Object Model (DOM) representation called
\href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/urdf}{Uniform Robot Description Format(URDF)}
created here at Willow Garage.

\TODO{Include updated tables of joint limits, torques, home positions, etc.}

\subsection{Drivetrains}
The joints in the PR2 are all actuated with brushed electric motors, and all
position sensing is done with optical incremental quadrature encoders.  Except
where noted, each joint has an optical sensor (interrupt or reflective) which is
used at startup to identify a home position.  Once the home position is
identified, the incremental encoders are used to track motion.  All drivetrains
in the robot have positive-engagement drives (gears or belts), and the motor
controllers monitor for encoder errors, so there should not be any drift in
measured position over time, although the repeatibility of the calibration
sensors may cause minor differences in position sensing between runs.

Velocity estimates are made by differentiating the position sensors, which will
lead to

\begin{description}
\item[Torso Drivetrain] The torso is driven up and down on a linear rail by a
  combination of a gas spring, which supports most of the weight of the torso,
  and a lead-screw which is driven via an RE40 motor with 113:1 gearhead
  connected to a continuous belt drive with a 5:1 reduction.  As a result of the
  force from the gas-spring not being constant over the range of travel, the
  lead-screw may be loaded up, down, or neutrally as different points of travel
  of the torso.  Position sensing of torso lift is done via optical encoder on
  the back of the motor, so any backlash in the lead-screw, belt, or gearhead is
  not sensed.  The torso joint is quite low efficiency, so commanding large
  forces (in the range of 1000 newtons) will be required to move the torso.  The
  maximum speed of the torso lift joint is limited by the thermal rating of the
  lead-screw nut.  Driving the torso lift link faster than the velocity limit
  will cause permanent damage to the lead-screw assembly.  Similary, driving at
  the safety limit but with excessive load Because of the large reduction, the
  torso lift link is capable of exerting high forces, so take care

\item[Head Drivetrains] The drivetrains for the head pan, head tilt, and laser
  tilt are all fairly similar.  Since precise pointing of sensors is important,
  all three of these joints have 10,000 count encoders mounted in the drivetrain
  after the major sources of potential backlash (gears).  The laser tilt axis is
  driven directly by the motor, through the encoder, and then via a belt-drive.
  The head pan and tilt are both driven from the motor through a gearset
  (planetary gearhead for the tilt joint and external spur gears for the pan
  joint).  The encoder is mounted on the shaft after the gearset, and then a
  belt drive is used for the final stage reduction.  These drivetrains are all
  high-efficiency and capable of very high velocities.  The software velocity
  and position limits on these joints are important to prevent hard collisions
  with the joint stops, which will cause damage to the hardware (espially to the
  sensors).  If the mass of the head is changes significantly, the pan and tilt
  link gains may need to be re-tuned.

\item[Caster Drivetrains] The three joints in each caster have basically the
  same drivetrain, which is a Maxon amax-32 motor with a gearhead and a
  continuous belt output.  Position sensing is done via an encoder on the back
  of the motor.  The drivetrain is efficient enough to be easily backdriveable.
  To rotate the caster, all three motors work together (the rotation motor
  drives the rotation, and the two wheels drive in opposite directions to
  provide additional forces.  To drive, the two wheel motors rotate in the same
  direction and the rotation motor helps to keep them aligned in the proper
  direction.

\item[Arm Drivetrains] The first four degree of freedom in the arm (shoulder
  pan, shoulder lift, upperarm roll, and elbow flex) are all driven with RE40
  motors that have single-stage planetary gearheads which output to a toothed
  pulley that runs on a belt.  These belts all have terminations at either end
  of a capstan on the moving link, which is how the torque is transmitted.  The
  terminations are also the way that these belts are tensioned, and propoer belt
  tensioning is important to prevent backlash (which can come from extra slack
  in the belt), friction (which can come from extra tension in the belt), and
  excess wear (which can come from a belt which is too tight, too loose, or just
  misaligned).  The position is measured via an optical encoder on the back of
  the motor, so the backlash of the gearhead and the stretch of the belt both
  contribute to the error in the sensed position.  Velocity limits are important
  on these joints to prevent motor damage from running over speed, as well as to
  prevent rapid decelleration which can damage the motor, gearhead, and belt.

These drivetrains are all fairly high efficiency, which means they can be
backdriven.  This is made possible by the low force requirements on those joints
due to the arm counterbalance.  The counterbalance uses a system of springs and
linkages to compensate for the effect of gravity on the upper arm and forearm
links.  The compensation should be effective throughout the range of motion of
the first four links of the arm.

\item[Arm Counterbalance] Although not an actuated drivetrain the arm counter
  balance is one of the more complicated mechanisms on the PR2. Inside of the
  shoulder turret there are two springs.  These springs are attached to belts
  which run over cams and provide a uniform downward force.

In the upper arm there is a four-bar linkage which transmits the torque through
to the shoulder lift joint, upper-arm roll joint, and elbow flex joint.  As the
arm moves through its configuration space the linkage changes the amount of
leverage with which the counterbalance is pulling which compensates for the
effect of the mass of the arm in difference configurations.

\item[Wrist Drivetrains] The forearm roll joint is driven by a motor in the
  upperarm with a planetary gearhead and external spur gear.  Position is
  measured via an optical encoder on the back of the motor.  Because of the
  higher gear reduction, the efficiency and backdriveability of this joint is
  not as good as that of the first four joints of the arm.

The wrist flex and roll use a differential drive between two motors.  If the
motors are turned in the same direction the wrist rolls, if they are turned
oposite the wrist flexes.  The differential bevel gears are attached after a
standard encoder, motor, gearhead assembly.


\item[gripper drivetrain] The gripper consists of two fingers with two joints
  each.  Within each finger, a four-bar linkage constrains the two joints to
  move together so that the fingertips remain parallel.  The two fingers are
  constrained together with a sector gear that meshes between the first
  phalanges of the two fingers.  The motion of the fingers is driven by a motor
  which drives a lead-screw in the palm of the hand.  This lead-screw is
  embedded in the four-bar linkage so that the rotation of the motor has a
  nonlinear relationship to the movement of the joints.  The gripper can be
  back-driven when significant force is applied.  Unlike all other
  non-continuous joints in the system, the gripper has no calibration flag.
  Initial homing is done by closing the gripper until it gets blocked and then
  treating that position as a zero point.  This means that the gripper is unable
  to detect if it has miscalibrated on startup.

\end{description}


\subsubsection{PR2 Coordinate System}
\label{sec:pr2_coordinate_system}
The reference {\bf home pose} of the PR2 robot is defined as the robot pose with
all of the joint angles at zero, with the PR2 robot facing the positive
x-direction, positive z-axis pointing upwards and positive y-axis pointing to
the {\it robot-left} (see Figure~\ref{fig:pr2_home_pose}).

\subsubsection{Drivetrain Limitations}
The drivetrains are high fidelity however there are still limitations.  Below
are the most observable limitations.

\subsection{Motion control}


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=290px]{images/mechanism_control.png}
\caption{Motion control layout.}
\label{fig:motion_control}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Motor controller boards}
Each motor/encoder on the PR2 has its dedicated \emph{Motor Controller Board}
(MCB). The MCB detects and counts transitions in the encoder signal, measures
the motor current, and commands the voltage going to the motor. Each MCB runs a
PI-control loop to control the motor current to a desired value, by commanding
the motor voltage. This control loop is executed at 100~kHz on an FPGA.  A
shared etherCAT link allows all MCB's in the PR2 to communicate with the main
computers.

\subsubsection{Controller manager}
The \emph{Controller Manager} (CM) is the lowest level software component that
directly talks to the MCB's. The CM runs in a hard realtime process and is
guaranteed to be executed at 1~kHz. This means that the CM sends desired motor
torques to the MCB's every milisecond, and receives measured motor torques and
positions in the same milisecond.

The CM has a dynamic plugin loading mechanism that allows controller algorithms
to get inserted and executed inside the 1~kHz realtime loop.


\subsection{Mechanical specs}

Before undertaking any new or risky operations with your PR2, please consult
these mechanical specifications. Do not operate the PR2 outside of these
specifications. If you have any questions about your PR2's specifications,
please contact Willow Garage Support.

\subsubsection{Environmental specs}

The PR2 is an indoor, household robot. Operating outside this type of environment could cause damage to the PR2, and  injury or death to operators.

\paragraph{Water}

The PR2 has not been tested for any type of contact with water or any other
liquid. Under no circumstances should the PR2 come in contact with water from
rain, mist, ground water (puddles) and any other liquid. Water contact can cause
damage to the electrical circuitry and the mechanism.

\paragraph{Temperature and Humidity}

Temperature testing of the PR2 has allowed the unit to run between 15 and
35C. Temperatures outside of this range can cause malfunctions in the PR2 power
system and instruments. The PR2 has been tested in high humidity, but under no
circumstances should condensation be allowed to form on the mechanism.

\paragraph{Drive Surface}

The drive surface of the PR2 must be capable of supporting the entire weight of
the PR2, about 450 pounds (220 kgs). If the surface is too soft, the PR2 can get
stuck and fail to drive. A commercial carpet or tile is recommended.

\paragraph{Incline Surface}

The PR2 is ready for ADA-compliant ramps, which are at 1/12 slope. Ramps that
are steeper than a 1/12 slope are unsafe and may be a tip over hazard.

\paragraph{Other Environmental Specs}

\begin{itemize}
\item UV exposure should be minimized. UV radiation can damage the PR2's skin
\item Dust and dirt can clog air filters
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Forces and torques}

Joint position, velocity, and force limits are implemented in the PR2's URDF
file, in the ``/etc/ros/urdf/robot.xml" file on your PR2. These joint limits
control the range of travel of the mechanism, the allowable velocity to prevent
overtravel. These limits are enforced by pr2\_controller\_manager, and are
designed to prevent poorly designed controllers from damaging the PR2 and
harming operators.

The limits below are from the PR2 URDF file. If a velocity or torque limit is
not specified, no value is enforced by pr2\_controller\_manager.

\begin{tabular}{l*{2}{c}}
Joint  & Velocity (rad/s or m/s) & Torque (Nm or N) \\
\hline \hline
$\ast$\_caster\_rotation\_joint        & -     & -  \\
$\ast$\_caster\_wheel\_$\ast$\_joint   & -     & -  \\

$\ast$\_shoulder\_lift\_joint          & 2.10  & 30.00 \\
$\ast$\_upper\_arm\_roll\_joint        & 3.27  & 30.00 \\
$\ast$\_elbow\_flex\_joint             & 3.30  & 30.00 \\
$\ast$\_forearm\_roll\_joint           & 3.60  & 30.00 \\
$\ast$\_wrist\_flex\_joint             & 3.10  & 10.00 \\
$\ast$\_wrist\_roll\_joint             & 3.60  & 10.00 \\
$\ast$\_gripper\_joint                 & 0.20  & 1000  \\
\end{tabular}

The PR2 motor controller boards (MCB's) will not allow a current command greater
than the maximum continuous current specified for the joint's actuator. This
means that maximum joint effort may be lower than the maximum effort specified
above. Below are the actuators for each joint (Maxon part number), and their
maximum allowable commanded current.

\begin{tabular}{ll*{2}{c}}
Joint  & Motor & Power (W) & Max Current \\

$\ast$\_gripper\_joint                & 222057 & 11  & 0.204 \\
\end{tabular}

More information about each actuator may be found in Maxon datasheets.

\subsubsection{Joint Limits and Types}

The position limits for the PR2 are specified below. These ``hard limits" are
the maximum travel for the mechanism.

\begin{tabular}{ll*{2}{c}}

\subsubsection{Modifying Joint Limits}

On the PR2, ``soft limits" stop the joints from reaching the full range of
motion to prevent damage to the mechanism. These soft limits, similar to a
virual spring, are specified in the robot's URDF file. For an explanation of
their implementation, see
http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2\_controller\_manager/safety\_limits.

The soft limits have been carefully implemented and validated by Willow
Garage. Under no circumstances should they be changed without prior written
authorization by Willow Garage Safety. Unauthorized and unvalidated modification
of these limits could cause mechanism damage and injury or death to PR2
operators.

Changing maximum allowable effort or maximum actuator current could cause
serious damage to the PR2 and injury or death to operators.

\section{Sensors}
The PR2 has a variety of sensors on its body:\\\\

\href{http://www.ros.org}{ros.org}.

\end{description}

\subsection{Forearm cameras}
Each forearm of the PR2 is equipped with a 12V 100Mb color ethernet camera. The
forearm camera uses the
\href{http://www.aptina.com/products/image_sensors/mt9v032c12stc/#overview}{Aptina
  MT9V032C12STC} imager chip and has a maximum resolution of 752 x 480 pixels at
15 fps. Additionally, the forearm camera has a 2.5mm F2.0 lens.  For more
information, see the
\href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/wge100_camera}{wge100\_camera} package at
\href{http://www.ros.org}{ros.org}.

\subsection{Gripper Sensors}
\begin{description}

\item[Accelerometer] The gripper of the PR2 is equipped with a
  \href{http://www.bosch-sensortec.com/content/language1/html/3474.htm}{Bosch
    BMA150} digital triaxal accelerometer. The measurement range ($\pm$2g,
  $\pm$4g, or $\pm$8g) and bandwidth (25Hz - 1500Hz) of the accelerometer can be
  selected in software. For more information, see the
  \href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/wge100_camera}{TODO} package at
  \href{http://www.ros.org}{ros.org}.

\item[Fingertip Pressure Sensors] The default fingertips of the PR2 are sturdy
  aluminum blocks with non-slip rubber covers for added friction and compliance
  in grasping.  However, the aluminum tips can be swapped out for an (included)
  set of RoboTouch tactile sensing pads made by Pressure Profile Systems, each
  with 22 tactile sensing elements: 15 in a 5x3 array on the front surface, 2 on
  top, 2 on each side, and 1 in back, near the top.  Each tactile element has a
  pressure range of 0-30 psi (0-205 kPa) and sensitivity of 0.1 psi (0.7 kPa).
  The sensors connect to the robot via an SPI ribbon cable and two screws, and
  have a maximum scan rate of 35 Hz.

The tactile sensors are highly fragile when not protected by the rubber
covering, and so care should be taken not to damage the rubber covering.  For
more information, see the
\href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/fingertip\_pressure}{fingertip\_pressure} package
at \href{http://ros.org}{ros.org}.

\item[Calibration LED]

\end{description}

\subsection{Inertial measurement unit}
The PR2 has an inertial measurement unit (IMU) located next to the tilting
laser. The IMU is a \href{http://www.microstrain.com/3dm-gx2.aspx}{MicroStrain
  Inertial-Link 3DM-GX2} which has an accelerometer range of $\pm$5g and a gyro
range of $300^\circ/s$. For more information, see the
\href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu}{microstrain\_3dmgx2\_imu}
package at \href{http://www.ros.org}{ros.org}.

\subsection{Speaker}
The PR2 has one
\href{http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/speakers_audio/home_pc_speakers/devices/199&cl=us,en}{Logitech
  V20 notebook speaker} located under the pan-tilt head next to the tilting
laser. For more information, see the
\href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/sound_play}{sound\_play} package at
\href{http://www.ros.org}{ros.org}.

\section{Power system}
\subsection{Overview}
The PR2 has a Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery system that is charged off of a 120V
wall current. The batteries power the computers, motors, and sensors on the
robot.  Power distribution is controlled by the \emph{Power Board}, which
communicates over Ethernet.
\subsection{Power Busses}
The robot has four internal power busses:
\begin{description}
\item[120V] The robot has a 3-prong IEC320 plug in the back of the base, which
  is connected through a circuit breaker to the four AC-DC converters used to
  charge the battery packs.  The system is designed to draw less than 15A, a
  standard 15A or 20A outlet will suffice. The load is capable at times of
  approaching the 15A limit, make sure there are no other devices which draw
  significant power on the same circuit (e.g., computers or heaters).
  \underline{Ideally, add image of back panel once we have the PR2 betas done w/
    Ryan's stickers on that panel.}
\item[Motor Power Bus] The motors get power through 3 descrete circuit breakers
  on the power board.  These create three independent motor power busses: left
  arm, right arm, and base/head.  The motor power bus can be in one of three
  states.  \emph{Enabled}, provides a direct connection to the unregulated
  battery power. The voltage will ranges from 52V when the batteries are fully
  discharged up to 72V when connected to wall power.  \emph{Standby}, the power
  board provides a low-power 18V supply that is used for communication and
  maintaing encoder position counts.  \emph{Disabled}, total shut-down of the
  circuit (e.g., in the event of a major power-system problem or manually
  disabled through the control panel).
\item[12V system bus] 12V power for sensors supplied by the power board. This is
  also the recommended source of power for user supplied accessories.
\item[12V computer power] 12V power for the computers supplied by the power
  board.
\end{description}
\subsection{Batteries}
The battery system has four battery bays comprised of four
\href{http://www.oceanserver-store.com/18.html}{Ocean Server BA95HC-FL} 14.4V
Li-ion batteries, a
\href{http://www.v-infinity.com/adtemplate_child.asp?c=710918&p=903285&catky=764537&subcatky1=46887&subcatky2=320934}{V-INFINITY
  VF-S320-18A-CF} 18V AC-DC Power Supply, and a
\href{http://www.oceanserver-store.com/xpmibamamo.html}{Ocean Server XP-04SRW}
four-channel high current battery controller. This provides the PR2 with
approximately two hours of countinous operation after a full recharge.  For more
information, see the \href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/ocean\_server}{ocean\_server}
package at \href{http://www.ros.org}{ros.org}.

\subsection{Power board}
The power board is central to the PR2's power system. This is where
the power from the batteries passes through to the rest of the
system. The power board monitors total power drawn from the batteries
by measuring the voltage and current at the power board input.

The battery power is used to provide regulated twelve volts to the computers and
the system bus through DC converters. Three unregulated circuits are also
provided with a unique electronic circuit breaker functionality. All outputs are
ultimately controlled by the processor located on this board.

Figure~\ref{fig:power_board} shows the power board, with e-stop receiver, removed from a robot.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pb_cropped1.jpg}
\caption{PR2 power board}
\label{fig:power_board}
\end{figure}


The power board contains an ARM processor with an ethernet interface. The
processor is responsible for performing a self test at power-on, monitoring the
state of all busses, providing information about the electrical system and
responding to commands. The power board is the first thing to turn on and can
not be turned off without switching off the DC circuit to the whole robot.

Besides supplying power the power board also interfaces with the emergency stop
radio receiver and the emergency stop button. The emergency stop system is
designed to reduce the power on the motor bus to a level where only the board
communications and their encoder positions are maintained. The red button and
radio system are described as providing a physical run/stop control over the
motors in the robot. This description is used because this mechanism is
implemented in hardware and can not be altered by software.

Please note that the run/stop system only reduces power to the motor power bus
and nothing else. If there is an electrical problem or power needs to be
shutdown for service, the red circuit breaker on the rear lower panel is the
only way to totally shut off the power board.\\

The power board contains many LEDs used to indicate status. 
\begin{description}
\item{12V Power Bus} The LEDs in green indicate the 3 regulated 12V
  outputs are enabled and functional, shown in
  Figure~\ref{fig:12Vbus}.
\item{MCB Power Bus}The Blue LEDs, Figure~\ref{fig:MCBbus}, indicate
  the motor bus power is enabled. Blue indicates a voltage higher than
  the 18V standby. These LEDs can also be orange if the output state
  is in the standby state.

\item{Power Board Status}The status LEDs,
  Figure~\ref{fig:powerboardstatus}, are used by the processor for
  debugging. In the event of a failure a status code will display on
  these LEDs. Someone must count the number of rapid blinks followed
  by a slight pause.  Status1 indicates the location where the fault
  occured and Status2 the cause of the fault.

\subsection{Power for sensors}
As mentioned previously, the power board provides a \emph{12V system bus}, that
provides a well regulated 12V supply. The regulated 12V supply is the only
supply designed for additions and expansion. This 12V supply is essentially
always on once the Power board completes a self test. It is also monitored for
undervoltage conditions and is fairly robust.

A few limitations should be followed when adding loads to the 12V user
supply. This supply is already supporting the 2 Hokuyo scanners, 2 ethernet
switches, the wireless AP and the E-stop receiver. Considering the loads and the
supplies capabilities with some headroom this leaves 5A for expansion.\\

{\bf 5A limit on 12V expansion}\\

Access to the 12V accessory bus is available in several locations:\\

Inside the top head assembly.\\

{\bf insert picture}\\


In the upper back.\\

{\bf insert picture}\\


In the lower back, directly connecting to the power board.\\

{\bf insert picture}\\

Before something is connected to this bus, strongly consider if hot plugging is
safe. If you are uncertain, the safest choice is to shut the power system off
completely.\\

All 12V connectors in the robot use the same connector, a 2x1 Molex Mini-Fit
Jr. The mating connector part number is {\bf 39-01-3022} or from Digikey {\bf
  WM1021-ND}. Pin one is negative and pin 2 is positive. Pin 2 is the pin
closest to the latch.
