\chapter{Running the PR2}
Running the PR2 requires a basic understanding of ROS (\href{http://www.ros.org}{http://www.ros.org}), the BSD-licensed 
Robot Operating System.  A ROS system consists of multiple processes running on multiple computers.  If you are not 
familiar with ROS, it is highly recommended that you follow some of the \href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials}{beginner tutorials} 
on ros.org. Familiarity with ROS tools will make using the robot much easier.  In particular, you should understand 
what a launch file is and how to run it, and how to run ROS with nodes on multiple computers. This chapter will walk 
you through starting up and running a PR2, using ROS.

\section{Getting set up}
\subsection{Out of the box}
If you are starting your PR2 for the first time at your institution, please read the previous sections,\ref{Setting up PR2 in your lab}.  
This will give you advice on setting up the network, setting the administrative password, and picking a safe location for 
charging the PR2.  This chapter assumes that the PR2 is already set up for your lab.
\subsection{Batteries and power}
Before running the robot, you need to make sure it has power.  The battery life of the PR2 is approximately two hours, 
so it is a good idea to keep the PR2 plugged in when not in use.  You can follow the instructions in this chapter to start up 
the PR2 while it is plugged into the power outlet, which will keep the batteries charged.
\subsection{Run-stop}
The PR2 will not run its motors unless both run-stop buttons (the red push-button on the middle of the PR2's back, and 
the yellow wireless run-stop transmitter) are enabled.  Before you operate the PR2, you should have the wireless run-stop 
nearby, so that you can shut down the motors if you need to.  Before turning on the robot, press the red ``stop'' button on the 
wireless run-stop transmitter to prevent the motors from moving before you are ready.

%Add image of red push-button on PR2's back here
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=150px]{run_stop.png}
\caption{The PR2 wireless run-stop.}
\label{fig:runstop}
\end{figure}

The wireless run-stop also uses battery power, which can run down. Therefore, it is a good idea to turn the wireless run-stop off when not in use. If the wireless run-stop runs out of battery charge, then the battery light (the light next to the battery symbol in the lower half of the wireless run-stop face) will flash. To change the battery, you will need a slotted screwdriver to open the wireless run-stop case and replace the batteries.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=125px]{opening_runstop.png}
\caption{Opening the PR2 wireless run-stop to change the batteries.}
\label{fig:opening-runstop}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Getting an account}
Before using the PR2, you will also need an account on the robot computers.  If you try to log in to the robot and the 
robot administrator has not created an account for you on the robot yet, then you will see:
\begin{verbatim}
Permission denied, please try again
\end{verbatim}
when you try to log in to the robot. Ask the robot administrator to create an account for you, using the instructions 
in section \ref{creating accounts}.
\section{Turning PR2 on}
To turn the PR2 on, you should first verify that the wireless run-stop is off. On the wireless run-stop, press the 
red button, and make sure there are no flashing lights on the wireless run-stop. Then switch the red DC breaker on 
the back panel of the robot to the ``on'' position.  

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=50px]{dc_breaker.png}
\caption{The PR2 DC breaker switch in the ON position.}
\label{fig:dc_breaker}
\end{figure}

You should see the red lights on the computers turn on, hear the fans spin up, and hear several rising-tone beeps from the computers 
as they boot.  The process of booting the computers will take about 5 minutes.  If the robot is already running, you can 
skip this step (but should still disable the wireless run-stop).
\subsection{Logging in}
Once the robot is on, \texttt{\href{http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?ssh}{ssh}} into the main computer using the account 
created for you by the administrator. 

In the following tutorial, we will use pr\textcolor{red}{x}1 to refer to the first computer on robot \textcolor{red}{x}.  
Ask your robot  administrator what name you should use for the robot you want to run. To log in to the robot, type
\begin{verbatim}
$ ssh username@prx1
\end{verbatim}
You will notice that you are already set up with a ROS environment.  To see what packages are available to you, type
\begin{verbatim}
$ rospack list-names
\end{verbatim}
and you should see a list of the ros packages currently in your path.

\subsection{Checking for other users}
If you logged in to a robot that was already running, you should check to see if anyone else is using the robot. To 
find out who else is using the robot, type
\begin{verbatim}
$ ckill list
\end{verbatim}
This will show you what programs are currently running on the robot.  If nothing shows up, then no one else is logged into the robot. If other people have processes running on the 
robot, you will need to find out if you can interrupt their work. You should find out who is on the robot and ask them 
to allow you to kill their processes so that you can work on the robot.  If you cannot find the people running processes 
on the robot, ask the robot adminstrator for guidance on what the policy is in your lab. If it is fine for you to kill 
the other processes running on the robot, you can type
\begin{verbatim}
$ sudo robot stop
\end{verbatim}
and all the processes that are being run on the robot will be killed.

\section{Starting the software}
The launch file /etc/pr2/pr2.launch is used to start up the basic functionality of the robot.  This includes drivers for 
the sensors, motors, speakers, projector, power system, and joystick as well as the default set of realtime controllers, 
processing and logging of diagnostics information, and monitors for various types of problems your robot could experience.  On a new robot, this launch file is standard, but if the robot you are working on has been altered (e.g., has additional sensors, has only one arm), then it is likely that someone administering the robot has also updated the /etc/pr2/pr2.launch file to work with your robot's configuration.

There are two ways to start the software on the PR2. The first way is easier than the second way.
 \subsection{Starting the software the easier way}

Once you are logged in and ready to start the robot, you can run the robot by typing
\begin{verbatim}
$ sudo robot start
\end{verbatim}
Running robot start will start the roslaunch for you in the background as a system user. This will 
allow you to continue to use your current terminal and the robot will keep running after you log out.  

To see what topics are being published in ROS now, you can type 
\begin{verbatim}
$ rostopic list
\end{verbatim}
This is a good way to check to see if you started up ROS successfully.

\subsection{Starting the software the manual way}
As an alternative to starting the software the easier way, you can also start the software manually. If you prefer to see everything that is going on, you can run the roslaunch manually, but you will need to keep that 
window open until you are done using the robot. Closing that the terminal in which you roslaunched will terminate the roslaunch.
\begin{verbatim}
$ roslaunch /etc/pr2/pr2.launch
\end{verbatim}
to start up the pr2.  

If you used ``roslaunch'' to start the robot, then you will need to open a new terminal and type
\begin{verbatim}
$ ssh username@prx1
$ rostopic list
\end{verbatim}
to see what topics are being published by the system in the new terminal while the roslaunch continues to run in the 
original terminal. Remember that \textcolor{red}{x} is a placeholding variable to be replaced with your robot's ID.

Either way, the robot should be running, but since you have the wireless run-stop disabled, the motors will not be moving.  

\section{Running the dashboard}
When running the robot, the pr2\_dashboard should always be up on your screen.  This is how the robot software will 
let you know if something is going wrong, and is also how you turn the motors and power on and off.  

On a computer with a built ROS installation (e.g., the base-station desktop computer that ships with the robot), not on the robot itself, set your ROS\_MASTER\_URI to point at the master running on the robot and launch the dashboard by typing
\begin{verbatim}
$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://prx1:11311
$ rosrun pr2_dashboard pr2_dashboard
\end{verbatim}
You should see the pr2\_dashboard control panel (a graphical user interface) appear and provide you with information about the state of the robot. It is ok if not all of the icons are green. In fact, the run-stops should be ``warning'' you that the wireless runstop is not on. 

If you do not see the pr2\_dashboard control panel appear, then there is a chance that you have not yet ``made'' the pr2\_dashboard. To do this, type
\begin{verbatim}
$ roscd pr2_dashboard
\end{verbatim}
to navigate to the pr2\_dashboard directory. Then type
\begin{verbatim}
$ rosmake pr2_dashboard
\end{verbatim}
to make pr2\_dashboard. Once this is done, you can try launching the dashboard again.

Take a moment to review the state of the robot. You can get a sense for the health of 
your robot by looking at the diagnostics information; click on the wrench on the far left.  Since you have the run-stop disabled, you see that the motors are giving you a warning because the robot was just turned on and the encoders on the joints have not 
been calibrated yet. 
% (CURRENTLY THIS IS AN ERROR.  SHOULD CHANGE TO WARNING BY ROBOT SHIP DATE)

If you see warnings or errors in any other sections, you should read the error messages and try to figure out what the 
problem is.  Ask your robot administrator for help if there are errors that you do not understand.
\subsection{Understanding pr2\_dashboard}
When running the PR2, the most important piece of software for you to understand and control the state of the system is 
the pr2\_dashboard. pr2\_dashboard, Figure~\ref{fig:dashboard}, is a GUI for debugging and controlling low-level state 
of the PR2. The dashboard displays the diagnostic, circuit breaker, run-stop, and battery status.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{pr2_dashboard.png}
\caption{The PR2 dashboard when all is well.}
\label{fig:dashboard}
\end{figure}
The robot will not usually start up with all green lights. In fact, if you bring up the robot properly, then you should see a dashboard display that looks more like Figure~\ref{fig:dashboard1}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{dashboard1.png}
\caption{The PR2 dashboard when all is well.}
\label{fig:dashboard1}
\end{figure}
The dashboard should look like Figure~\ref{fig:dashboard1} because the wireless run-stop should be off. You can tell that the wireless run-stop is off by mousing over the dashboard to see the tooltips, which describe what each icon means. See Figure~\ref{fig:dashboard2}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{dashboard2.png}
\caption{The PR2 dashboard when starting up the robot.}
\label{fig:dashboard2}
\end{figure}

Now you can enable the wireless run-stop by pressing the green ``START'' button on the wireless run-stop. If this works properly, then you should see the robot run-stop icon turn green in the dashboard. The dashboard should update to look like Figure~\ref{fig:dashboard3}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{dashboard3.png}
\caption{The PR2 dashboard when the wireless run-stop is enabled.}
\label{fig:dashboard3}
\end{figure}

The following sections describe the other information displayed in the dashboard.

\begin{description}
\item[Diagnostic Status] The state of the robot is shown by the diagnostic indicators in the pr2\_dashboard. \\

    \newcolumntype{S}{>{\centering\arraybackslash} m{.9cm} }%
    \begin{tabular}{m{6cm}SSSS}

   \end{tabular}

\item[Circuit Breaker Status] The circuit breakers are labeled L/B/R, which stand for Left Arm, Base/Spine, and Right Arm. 
Each breaker can be in one of four states, and clicking on any of the breakers will pop up a menu (Figure~\ref{fig:breaker_menu}), allowing you to change the state of one or all of them:
\begin{figure}[h]

   \end{tabular}

\item[Run-stop Status] The runstop indicators display the status of the PR2 runstops and their states cannot be changed using the dashboard. 
There are two run-stops on the robot, a wireless run-stop, see \ref{wirelessrunstop}, and a red push button run-stop on the back of the robot.\\

    \newcolumntype{S}{>{\centering\arraybackslash} m{2.5cm} }%

   \end{tabular}

\item[Battery Status]
The battery will change its color and \% filled based on the amount of battery remaining. It will also show a power-plug symbol if the robot is charging.
    \newcolumntype{S}{>{\centering\arraybackslash} m{1.85cm} }%

                     \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{battery_charging.png}\\
   \end{tabular}


\end{description}

\section{Calibrating the joints}
If you do not discover any problems in the diagnostics, and you want to continue with robot bringup, press the green 
button on the wireless run-stop.  This should change the state of the run-stop indicator on the dashboard to a green 
circle, and will allow the robot to turn power on for the motors.  The next step is to enable the circuit breakers 
(marked L, B, R).  When you click on the circuit-breaker icon, select ``enable all'' from the menu to turn on all 
three breakers.

Finally, check that the area around the robot is safe for it to move its arms, click on the picture of a motor, and 
select ``reset motors.''  When you do this, the robot will move its joints to find the absolute reference positions of 
each joint so that it can calibrate the mechanism.  When calibration is finished, you should see all the icons in the 
dashboard reading OK.

\section{Tucking the robot arms}

Before driving a robot around, it is best to tuck the robot arms. If you do not tuck the robot arms before driving, then the arms are likely to swing around while the robot is moving.

To run the tuckarm package, type into the robot computer (prx1):
\begin{verbatim}
$ rosrun pr2_tuckarm tuckarm.py b
\end{verbatim}
This will tuck both robot arms. The feedback from tuckarm should display something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
[INFO] 1264099125.710039: Waiting for controller manager to start
[INFO] 1264099125.718283: Tucking both left and right arm
\end{verbatim}

For more information about how to drive the robot around, see the 
\href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_tuckarm}{tuckarm} instructions at \href{http://www.ros.org}{ros.org}.

\section{Driving with the joystick}
To move the robot, you can now drive it around with the joystick.  To do this, you will need to open a new terminal window with a new ssh connection 
to the robot and run the teleop\_joystick launch file
\begin{verbatim}
$ ssh username@prx1
$ roslaunch pr2_teleop teleop_joystick.launch 
\end{verbatim}

Be sure to check to see if the robot is plugged in (e.g., ethernet cables or power cables)! If it is plugged in, then be very cautious to avoid pulling the cables out improperly.

Once the teleop\_joystick node is running, press the pairing button (Figure~\ref{fig:ps3_pairing}) in the middle of the 
joystick to pair it with the robot (the four LEDs on the jostick will flash when paired). 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.40]{pairing.png}
\caption{Pairing the joystick with the PR2.}
\label{fig:ps3_pairing}
\end{figure}
Then to control the robot, use L1 (Figure~\ref{fig:buttons}) as the deadman.
No commands are sent without the deadman engaged.
While pressing L1, use the other buttons for the following movements:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{ps3joy_buttons.png}
\caption{The PS3 buttons.}
\label{fig:buttons}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Right stick: translate the base
\item Left stick: Yaw (rotate) the base
\item "L2": The "head button" allows the sticks to control the head instead of the base.
\item "R1" : Run button commands the base faster
\item "Triangle", "X": Move the torso up and down 
\end{enumerate}

For more information about how to drive the robot around, see the 
\href{http://www.ros.org/wiki/ps3joy/Tutorials/UsingJoystickWithPR2}{ps3joy} tutorial at \href{http://www.ros.org}{ros.org}. 

\section{Visualizing sensor data}
To see the sensor data from the robot, you can use rviz on the offboard computer (e.g., base station).  Again, you will 
need to open a new terminal window and configure the ROS\_MASTER\_URI to point at the robot, so run
\begin{verbatim}
$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://prx1:11311
$ rosrun rviz rviz
\end{verbatim}
and you should see rviz launch with a visualization of the robot.  

If you do not see the rviz appear, then there is a chance that you have not yet ``made'' rviz yet. To do this, type
\begin{verbatim}
$ roscd rviz
\end{verbatim}
to navigate to the rviz directory. Then type
\begin{verbatim}
$ rosmake rviz
\end{verbatim}
to make rviz. Once this is done, you can try launching rviz again.

For more information about how to view different types 
of data coming from the robot, see the \href{http://ros.org/wiki/rviz}{rviz} documentation at 
\href{http://www.ros.org}{ros.org}.
(TODO - WITH THE CURRENT LAUNCH FILE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE CAMERA DATA)

\section{What next?}
From here, you can do what you want on the robot.  (NOTE TO AUTHORS: Point to instructions for writing code and to a list of other 
applications and things to do with the robot.)

\section{Putting Away the PR2}
To properly put away the PR2, you should drive the robot to the appropriate location in your lab, plug in the robot to recharge the batteries, turn off the wireless run-stop, stop the processes on the robot, and log off of the robot.

First, put away the robot. Drive the robot to the appropriate location in your lab and plug it in to recharge.
% Add notes here about how to recharge the robot without getting shocked.

Second, stop all the processes running on the robot. If you want to stop all of the processes running on the robot and log off of the robot, but not turn off the robot computers, then open a new terminal and type:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ssh username@prx1
$ sudo robot stop
$ exit
\end{verbatim}
This logs you into the robot, stops the robot, and exits from that robot computer terminal.

As an alternative, if you also want to turn off the robot computers, then open a new terminal and type:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ssh username@prx1
$ sudo pr2-shutdown
$ exit
\end{verbatim}
If you turn off the robot, you will hear four sets of descending beeps from the robot computers. Then the red lights on each of the computers will turn off. If this does not happen, then the robot computers might not be completely shut down properly.

If someone was waiting to use the robot after you, be sure to let them know that you are done with the robot.
